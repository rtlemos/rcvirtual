# rcvirtual: Virtual references classes for statistical modeling
This package contains a set of reference classes for statistical modelling with R. These classes are called "virtual", in the sense that they are designed to set the wireframe for other, "concrete" classes, that implement a specific statistical model. After installing, type the following to get started: 

`vignette('rcvirtual-vignette', package = 'rcvirtual')`
